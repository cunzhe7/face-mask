# face-mask
Detecting wearing mask or not


For IoT or weak performance devices might use haar cascade classifier to focus on whoâ€™s not wearing a mask


For some better device we can use res10 for a real time detection


For more advanced devices, or just image, we can use RetinaNet over Res152/MobileNet
